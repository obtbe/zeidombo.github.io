In this project, I created a captivating email report dashboard using Power BI. The process involved designing visuals within Power BI and refining the design in Figma. I organized the data, including email addresses, subjects, countries, and timestamps, into a structured data model. The dashboard's objective was to provide insights into email volume trends, distribution between received and sent emails, average email count per week, and daily traffic patterns. I focused on making the report descriptive and visually appealing, emphasizing key metrics and trends through carefully crafted visualizations. The resulting dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of email activity, enhancing data-driven decision-making.
