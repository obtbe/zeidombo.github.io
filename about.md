From a young age, I've been captivated by the interplay of numbers and the natural world. My grandfather, a seasoned equestrian, played a formative role in nurturing this dual fascination. As he guided me through the rhythmic movements of horseback riding in his rustic family stable, he would simultaneously weave in lessons on the underlying mathematics - the angles, the leverage, the precise calculations required to achieve harmony with the animals.

This early exposure to the elegance of quantitative reasoning, juxtaposed with the earthy textures of the great outdoors, left an indelible mark. I found myself equally enthralled by the abstract patterns of numbers and the tangible patterns of the natural environment.

Today as a Google certified data analyst and a [DS4A fellow](https://www.credential.net/67d98bab-1d5c-482f-91bd-3b54c6690092) at Correlation One, I can easily navigate uncertain situations to produce the desired outcome because of my level-head, analytical skills, communication, and global outlook. That has allowed me much success in my endeavors as the Founder of Quantidum, a data analytics consulting firm where we use advanced analytical tools and techniques to help businesses make better decisions. My passion for learning and continuous development has propelled me further than I could imagine and have inspired the people around me.

I was encouraged to get involved in the community and give back in whatever way possible. I'm currently working on a non-profit, MANSAPI, to cultivate a passion for STEM subjects among students in Mali through educational initiatives, fostering a deep appreciation and enthusiasm for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

Thank you for visiting my website. I hope you find both the beauty and power of data reflected in its content.
