You're probably looking for [this](https://ehmatthes.github.io/).

I teach high school math and science at a small school in southeast Alaska. I wrote [Python Crash Course](http://nostarchpress.com/pythoncrashcourse/), which is available through [No Starch Press](http://nostarchpress.com/pythoncrashcourse) and [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-Project-Based-Introduction/dp/1593276036/). When I'm not teaching or writing, I like to play outdoors.
